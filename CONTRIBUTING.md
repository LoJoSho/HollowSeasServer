Hey there! We have glad you have decided to help us work on HollowSeas, a community dedicated to creating memories for players!

When you submit, keep these in mind:
* Make sure the request is in the proper language
* Make sure it is appropriate
* Make sure that it is .yml, .txt, or .json file compatable depending on the file being edited
* When Submitting, make sure to explain why you have made this change (Just someone like 1 sentence will do)

Further questions can be directed at LoJoSho.

Thanks for contributing to HollowSeas!
