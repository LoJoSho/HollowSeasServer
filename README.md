Welcome to the HollowSeasServer GitHub page, **BETA**!

### Why?

I decided that you should have the ability to make changes to the files yourself. It will allow you to contribute directly to the server for free that will make direct changes to the server itself! Once a pull request is accepted, it will be uploaded to the server to be uploaded. Within 24 hours, your change would have been fully implemented!

# Plugins available to make changes to (More to be added):
* Deluxe Menus (Handles our custom menus)
* Civs

## What are pull requests?

Pull Requests are how you can make suggestions to the files. Let's say you want to add a few more blocks to a house. You would go to the Civs file for the house you want to edit, then click "Edit this file".

Once you have made your edits, commit these changes. Try to name the commitment relevant to what you are editing, however, it is not required.

Next, as seen with me editing this Civs file, you are directed to a page that will either tell you if it is compatible (most likely it is) or there is a problem. Feel free to put as many of your edited files in here (If you are editing multiple files, commit them all before pulling a request)

Next, just hit "Create Pull Request" and will create a pull request! You are done and it is on its way to get reviewed and uploaded!
